Capture and convert data from the illuminate grade site into a usable report.
For one thing, you can verify calculation of a grade from the data, and
forecast a future grade (with some elbow grease of your own).


How-to:

1. Copy-and-paste data from the web site into a file, 'data.csv'. The copied
   data should range from the 'Category Breakdown' header to the end of the
   'Assignments data'
2. 'make'

To dos:

1. Obviate the error-prone copy-and-paste operation by scraping directly from
   the web site.
